      <h1>Groundwater Supply</h1>
      <p>
        Groundwater contributes more than 80% of potable water supply to rural
        communities in Southern Africa. Waters Without Frontiers has extensive
        experience in the identification and development of groundwater
        resources for water supplies. The company’s expertise includes among
        others, the following:
      </p>
      <h3>Remote Sensing for borehole siting</h3>
      <p>
        The company uses latest satellite images and aerial photographs to
        identify lineaments associated with geological structure that influence
        groundwater occurrence and movement. We also use drone technology to
        carry out quick site reconnaissance to zoom in on interesting features
        on the ground.
      </p>
      <h3>Geophysical survey</h3>
      <p>
        The company employs three complimentary geophysical survey techniques,
        consisting of electromagnetic (EM) and magnetic traverses, and
        electro-seismic soundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="bold_italic">Electromagnetic traverses</span> are
        conducted to locate conductive saturated fracture zones and faults. A
        PCFDEM-24Bit frequency domain electromagnetic instrument was used.
        Boasting eight frequencies, the instrument takes eight measurements at
        each station, with each measurement corresponding to a different
        frequency. Each frequency in turn, corresponds to a different depth of
        ground penetration. The higher the frequency, the lower the depth of
        ground penetration and vice versa. The instrument can achieve ground
        penetration depth in excess of 300 metres. The instrument allows for the
        measurement of ground electrical conductivity variations in both the
        horizontal and vertical directions; thus enabling the production of two
        dimensional vertical conductivity sections or pseudo-sections.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="bold_italic">Magnetic traverses</span> are conducted to
        locate contacts between dolerite intrusion and the host rocks. These
        contacts are characterised by significant fracturing as explained
        earlier. Magnetic traverses were conducted along the same lines and
        station spacing as EM traverses.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="bold_italic">Electro-Seismic Survey</span>{' '}
        theoretically can pick the presence of a water table. The technique is
        based on the principle that when a seismic wave generated at the surface
        reaches the water table in permeable rock, the water is forced to move
        relative to its rock surroundings as the pulse passes. This motion
        creates a small electrical pulse that is measurable at the surface by
        pairs of electrodes close to the shot point. The technique is still at
        its infancy in South Africa; hence is being explored. Water strikes are
        indicated by spikes on seismic traces.

      <h3>Environmental Assessments</h3>
      <p>
        South Africa has enacted laws requires that those who cause negative
        impacts on the environment own up and remedy the impacts. Groundwater
        resources are particularly vulnerable to impacts of industrial, mining
        and farming activities. The impacts relate to degradation of water
        quality due to pollution, and depletion of groundwater resources due to
        over pumping and mine dewatering. Waters Without Frontiers’ expertise
        include:{' '}

        <h3>Environmental Authorizations</h3>

        <p>
          Waters Without Frontiers provides geohydrological input into
          environmental authorisations such as:

      <h3>Groundwater Dewatering</h3>

      <p>
        Dewatering is essential for safe and efficient operations mines and
        excavated construction sites. These operations can be flooded, making
        them dangerous to work in and preventing access to valuable minerals in
        the case of mines. Dewatering also helps to stabilise the ground and
        prevent cave-ins. Waters Without Frontiers provides the following
        expertise:{' '}
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Identification and delineation of geological structures that channel
          groundwater to the site through the use of geophysical surveys.
        </li>
        <li>

        Groundwater modelling is used across the spectrum of hydrogeology from
        predicting the impact of groundwater abstraction for domestic use to
        impact of dewatering in mines and construction sites, to the migration
        of contaminants.
      </p>

        The company uses a host of groundwater modelling codes that include
        Visual mudflow Flex, PWIN and Free Flow
      </p>
