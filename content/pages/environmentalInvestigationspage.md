      <p>
        South Africa has enacted laws requires that those who cause negative
        impacts on the environment own up and remedy the impacts. Groundwater
        resources are particularly vulnerable to impacts of industrial, mining
        and farming activities. The impacts relate to degradation of water
        quality due to pollution, and depletion of groundwater resources due to
        over pumping and mine dewatering. Waters Without Frontiersâ€™ expertise
        include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Assessment of the nature and extent of groundwater contamination.
        </li>
        <li>Assessment of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD).</li>
        <li>Design of groundwater monitoring programme.</li>
        <li>
          Groundwater sampling and geohydro-chemical evaluation according to
          established standards and guidelines. The company has portable battery
          operated water sampling pumps
        </li>
        <li>Delineation of contamination plumes,</li>
        <li>Delineation of contaminant capture zones,</li>
        <li>
          Groundwater modelling to simulate potential impacts on groundwater and
          assess effectiveness of proposed remedial action.
        </li>
        <li>Design and implementation of remediation measures,</li>
      </ul>

  - description: Land stability is a critical factor in safe land use, especially in areas where water may pose a risk. Our team conducts comprehensive investigations into soil properties and geological hazards. The insights we gain from these investigations enable us to evaluate the risk of landslides and other hazards, ensuring the safety of communities and the environment.
