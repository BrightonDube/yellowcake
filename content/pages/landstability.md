  ### *LAND STABILITY AND SUBSIDENCE STUDIES IN DOLOMITIC ENVIRONMENTS*

  Structures erected on carbonate rocks such as dolomite and limestone are vulnerable to destruction due to land subsidence and sinkhole formation. Waters Without Frontiers has the expertise to conduct a risk assessment on the suitability of land for housing and infrastructural development. Associated activities include:

  -	Gravity geophysical survey to locate cavities,

  -	Creation of gravity contours to zoom in on potential cavities,

  -	Drilling to verify the cavities,

  -	Recommendation of remedial measures

  ### Emergency Water Supply

  One of the most important needs for communities hit by disasters, whether natural or man-made, is the provision of emergency safe and clean drinking water immediately after the disaster. Waters Without Frontiers has capacity to:  

  -	Assess water requirements of communities hit by the disaster,

  -	Identify and mobilise emergency water supply resources to alleviate human suffering. Such resources include:

  - Trailer mounted mobile water purification plants,

  -	Lifesaver bottles that have a filter which can make the most revolting water
   drinkable in seconds, enabling the use of water directly from the river.

  -	Anti-bacteria tablets.

  -	Tanker trucks to affected communities
