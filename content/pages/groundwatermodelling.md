 <h3>Groundwater Modelling</h3>

      <p>
        Groundwater modelling is used across the spectrum of hydrogeology from
        predicting the impact of groundwater abstraction for domestic use to
        impact of dewatering in mines and construction sites, to the migration
        of contaminants.
      </p>

      <p>
        The company uses a host of groundwater modelling codes that include
        Visual mudflow Flex, PWIN and Free Flow
      </p>

      <p>The activities include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Development of a geohydrological conceptual model,</li>
        <li>
          Assignment of hydraulic parameters to the geohydrological conceptual
          model,
        </li>
        <li>Model calibration to ensure the model replicates reality,</li>
        <li>Simulation of groundwater responses to stresses </li>
        <li>Evaluation of the effectiveness of remediation systems,</li>
        <li>Delineating well capture zones for wellhead protection,</li>
        <li>Simulating natural attenuation of contaminated groundwater,</li>
        <li>Determining exposure pathways for risk assessment.</li>
      </ul>

- description: Land stability is a critical factor in safe land use, especially in areas where water may pose a risk. Our team conducts comprehensive investigations into soil properties and geological hazards. The insights we gain from these investigations enable us to evaluate the risk of landslides and other hazards, ensuring the safety of communities and the environment.
