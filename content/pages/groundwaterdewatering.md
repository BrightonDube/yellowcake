  <h3>Environmental Assessments</h3>
       <p>
         South Africa has enacted laws requires that those who cause negative
         impacts on the environment own up and remedy the impacts. Groundwater
         resources are particularly vulnerable to impacts of industrial, mining
         and farming activities. The impacts relate to degradation of water
         quality due to pollution, and depletion of groundwater resources due to
         over pumping and mine dewatering. Waters Without Frontiersâ€™ expertise
         include:{' '}

  ### *LAND STABILITY AND SUBSIDENCE STUDIES IN DOLOMITIC ENVIRONMENTS*

  Structures erected on carbonate rocks such as dolomite and limestone are vulnerable to destruction due to land subsidence and sinkhole formation. Waters Without Frontiers has the expertise to conduct a risk assessment on the suitability of land for housing and infrastructural development. Associated activities include:

  -	Gravity geophysical survey to locate cavities,

  -	Creation of gravity contours to zoom in on potential cavities,

  -	Drilling to verify the cavities,

  -	Recommendation of remedial measures

  ### Emergency Water Supply

  One of the most important needs for communities hit by disasters, whether natural or man-made, is the provision of emergency safe and clean drinking water immediately after the disaster. Waters Without Frontiers has capacity to:  

  -	Assess water requirements of communities hit by the disaster,

  -	Identify and mobilise emergency water supply resources to alleviate human suffering. Such resources include:

  - Trailer mounted mobile water purification plants,

  -	Lifesaver bottles that have a filter which can make the most revolting water
   drinkable in seconds, enabling the use of water directly from the river.

  -	Anti-bacteria tablets.

  -	Tanker trucks to affected communities

  - description: Groundwater management is a complex task that requires precise prediction and monitoring. We use advanced mathematical models to simulate groundwater flow and distribution. These models help us understand aquifer systems, manage water resources effectively, and devise solutions for groundwater contamination problems.

  - description: Land stability is a critical factor in safe land use, especially in areas where water may pose a risk. Our team conducts comprehensive investigations into soil properties and geological hazards. The insights we gain from these investigations enable us to evaluate the risk of landslides and other hazards, ensuring the safety of communities and the environment.
