  <h3>Groundwater Dewatering</h3>

      <p>
        Dewatering is essential for safe and efficient operations mines and
        excavated construction sites. These operations can be flooded, making
        them dangerous to work in and preventing access to valuable minerals in
        the case of mines. Dewatering also helps to stabilise the ground and
        prevent cave-ins. Waters Without Frontiers provides the following
        expertise:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Identification and delineation of geological structures that channel
          groundwater to the site through the use of geophysical surveys.
        </li>
        <li>
          Evaluation and estimation of quantities of groundwater to be removed
          from the system,
        </li>
        <li>Design and layout of dewatering boreholes,</li>
        <li>Recommendation of discharge rates for dewatering boreholes,</li>
        <li>
          Assessment of potential impact of dewatering on groundwater resources
          in neighbouring areas,
        </li>
        <li>
          Simulation of dewatering using groundwater-modelling, and evaluation
          of its effectiveness.
        </li>
        <li>
          Recommendation of measures to mitigate inflows into excavations.
        </li>
      </ul>

  - description: Groundwater management is a complex task that requires precise prediction and monitoring. We use advanced mathematical models to simulate groundwater flow and distribution. These models help us understand aquifer systems, manage water resources effectively, and devise solutions for groundwater contamination problems.

  - description: Land stability is a critical factor in safe land use, especially in areas where water may pose a risk. Our team conducts comprehensive investigations into soil properties and geological hazards. The insights we gain from these investigations enable us to evaluate the risk of landslides and other hazards, ensuring the safety of communities and the environment.
